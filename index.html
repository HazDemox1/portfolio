                <h2>Design & Development</h2>
                <p>I started learning web design at 15, thinking it would be easy and something I could do well. Recently, I’ve moved into web development and found that I really enjoy it. Over time, I’ve gained solid experience designing UI components and web pages.</p>

                <h2>Marketing Experience</h2>
                <p>I used to be a content creator under the name 'HazDemox' before rebranding. During that time, I gained experience in marketing and audience engagement. I’ve also worked on marketing for various niches, including helping JustEarn grow to 10,000 members in just two weeks.</p>

                <h2>MM2BIG</h2>
                <p>I helped design the UI for an old site called mm2big.com, a Roblox-based arcade where users could coinflip Murder Mystery 2 items for a chance to win more. I created around 95% of the user interface, focusing on a smooth and engaging experience.</p>

                <p>I worked on rubyearn.com, a survey-based rewards site where users could earn gems to cash out through Robux, crypto, PayPal, gift cards, and more. Although it never launched, it was a planned project I designed with a full user flow in mind.</p>
